# 0x03. Python - Data Structures: Lists, Tuples
This project is about how to use and manipulated Data structures (list, tuples) in Python3.

## General
+ What are lists and how to use them
+ What are the differences and similarities between strings and lists
+ What are the most common methods of lists and how to use them
+ How to use lists as stacks and queues
+ What are list comprehensions and how to use them
+ What are tuples and how to use them
+ When to use tuples versus lists

## Requirements
+ Allowed editors: `vi, vim, emacs`
+ All your files will be interpreted/compiled on `Ubuntu 14.04 LTS` using `python3` (version 3.4.3)
+ All your files should end with a new line
+ The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
+ Your code should use the `PEP 8` style (version 1.7.*)
+ All your files must be executable
