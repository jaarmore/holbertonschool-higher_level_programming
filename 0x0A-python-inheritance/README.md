### 0-lookup.py
Function that returns the list of available attributes and methods of an object:

### 1-my_list.py, tests/1-my_list.txt
class MyList that inherits from list

### 2-is_same_class.py
Function that returns True if the object is exactly an instance of the specified class 

### 3-is_kind_of_class.py
Function that returns True if the object is an instance of

### 4-inherits_from.py
Function that returns True if the object is an instance of a class that inherited

### 5-base_geometry.py
Write an empty class BaseGeometry

### 6-base_geometry.py
class BaseGeometry (based on 5-base_geometry.py

### 7-base_geometry.py, tests/7-base_geometry.txt
class BaseGeometry (based on 6-base_geometry.py).

### 8-rectangle.py
class Rectangle that inherits from BaseGeometry (7-base_geometry.py)

### 9-rectangle.py
