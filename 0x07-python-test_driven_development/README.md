# 0x07. Python - Test-driven development
This topic is about how to use and apply TDD on Python programs.

## General
+ Whats an interactive test
+ Why tests are important
+ How to write Docstrings to create tests
+ How to write documentation for each module and function
+ What are the basic option flags to create tests
+ How to find edge cases

### Requirements
+ Allowed editors: `vi, vim, emacs`
+ All your files will be interpreted/compiled on `Ubuntu 14.04 LTS` using `python3 (version 3.4.3)`
+ All your files should end with a new line
+ The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
+ A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
+ Your code should use the `PEP 8` style `(version 1.7.*)`

### Python Test Cases
+ Allowed editors: `vi, vim, emacs`
+ All your files should end with a new line
+ All your test files should be inside a folder `tests`
+ All your test files should be text files `(extension: .txt)`
+ All your tests should be executed by using this command: `python3 -m doctest ./tests/*`

### 0-add_integer.py, tests/0-add_integer.txt
Function that adds 2 integers.

### 2-matrix_divided.py, tests/2-matrix_divided.txt
Function that divides all elements of a matrix.

### 3-say_my_name.py, tests/3-say_my_name.txt
Ffunction that prints `My name is <first name> <last name>`

### 4-print_square.py, tests/4-print_square.txt
Function that prints a square with the character `#`

### 5-text_indentation.py, tests/5-text_indentation.txt
function that prints a text with 2 new lines after each of these characters:` ., ? and : `

### tests/6-max_integer_test.py
Since the beginning you have been creating Interactive tests. For this exercise, you will add Unittests.

In this task, you will write unittests for the function `def max_integer(list=[]):`
